## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Start Hub for empty workspaces + index.html mojibake cleanup

### Summary

- User tested a fresh world folder (`G:\AI\LoreRelayWorlds\PostApocalypse`) and found the empty-state chat log gave no indication of what to do. Discussed with ChatGPT, who investigated the existing Quickstart feature (already fully implemented: `#quickstart-modal` + `quickstartRunner.ts`, just poorly discoverable behind an unlabeled 🚀 icon) and produced a hybrid spec: keep Quickstart as "generate roughly from one line," add a new (future) "GM interview" mode as "build via Q&A," and show both as a `Start Hub` choice screen whenever the workspace is empty, with theme presets feeding either path.
- Implemented the UI/discoverability half per ChatGPT's spec (backend interview-mode logic intentionally deferred as future work, per spec):
  - `webview/index.html` — new `#start-hub` block (sibling of `#chat-log`, not a child — `chatLog.innerHTML = ''` on re-render would otherwise wipe it) with a title, two big option buttons (Quick Generate / Build via Q&A), and 5 preset chips.
  - `webview/styles/10-layout-chat.css` — `.start-hub` fills the same flex slot as `#chat-log`; `#chat-log.hidden`/`.start-hub.hidden` toggle between them.
  - `webview/modules/90-bootstrap.js` — `updateStartHubVisibility()` (single source of truth: shows hub iff `messageHistory.length === 0`), preset chip single-select state, Quick Generate button opens the existing quickstart modal and pre-fills its prompt textarea with the selected preset's one-line description, Q&A button pre-fills `freeInput` with an interview-kickoff template (consistent with the earlier image-mismatch-flag button pattern) and focuses it rather than auto-sending.
  - `webview/modules/10-game-state.js` — `renderMessage()` now calls `updateStartHubVisibility()` at its very end, so every code path that adds a message (welcome check, `applyGameState` loading real entries, remote input, system messages) automatically keeps the hub's visibility correct without needing to hook each call site individually.
  - Replaced the old unconditional `addSystemMessage(T('webview.welcome'))` call with the hub (its title serves the same purpose); i18n key `webview.welcome` is now unused but left defined (harmless, not worth the risk of touching it).
  - 13 new i18n keys × 4 locales.
- **Unrelated finding, fixed while in the file**: `webview/index.html` had real mojibake — 11 quick-reply button fallback labels (garbled emoji + text), ~15 corrupted HTML comments, and an `…` (ellipsis) that had been mangled into `窶ｦ` repeated across ~13 character-creator placeholder strings. Verified against the corresponding `locales/*.json` values (which were clean) that this was low-severity — `applyI18n()` overwrites the fallback text immediately on load — but cleaned it up for source readability. Confirmed 0 remaining occurrences of the known corruption markers across `webview/`, `src/`, and `locales/` afterward.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js` passed.
- `node scripts/validate_utf8_docs.js` — OK (267 files).
- `npm test` passed (full suite green).

### Next

- GM interview mode itself (the "💬 Build via Q&A" backend) is not implemented — clicking it only pre-fills a kickoff message into the normal chat input, which then flows through whichever GM bridge provider is already configured. Per ChatGPT's spec, when that gets built: keep `setupComplete` as an advisory signal only, use an explicit always-visible "generate the world from this" button as the real trigger (not AI self-judgment), and route through `invokeGmBridge` (not `quickstartRunner.ts`'s `generateText()`, which only supports openrouter/ollama/koboldcpp) so it works with any configured provider.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Image/narrative mismatch feedback button

### Summary

- User + ChatGPT identified a UX gap during test play: a generated scene image (map spread on a table, per the narration) didn't match what was actually rendered (map on the ground, no table/characters). ChatGPT proposed a "flag this image" button that pre-fills a template complaint for the GM.
- Implemented the simpler of ChatGPT's two proposals (template pre-fill into free input, sent through the existing GM turn flow) rather than the fuller accept/discard/retake variant, to avoid new message types or backend changes.
- `webview/modules/10-game-state.js` — added a "🗯️ Flag Mismatch" button next to the existing regenerate button on every scene image; wrapped both in a new `.image-editor-actions` flex row. Clicking it sets `freeInput.value` to a template string and focuses/positions the cursor at the end so the user can type the specific complaint before sending normally.
- `webview/styles/80-image-gen.css` — new `.image-editor-actions` row wrapper; `.image-flag-btn` gets a distinct amber accent from the existing purple regenerate/manual-gen buttons; restored `align-self: flex-end` on `.manual-gen-btn` specifically since it's still used standalone outside the new row.
- i18n: 3 new keys (`webview.image.flagMismatchBtn/Title/Template`) in all 4 locales.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js` passed.
- `npm test` passed (full suite green).

### Next

- Not yet built: the fuller "accept / discard / regenerate with corrected prompt" 4-button variant ChatGPT also proposed. Left as a follow-up if the simple version proves not enough — would need a new postMessage type and prompt-rewriting logic on the image-gen side.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Phase 8A quest completion rewards + Phase 10 status check

### Summary

- User relayed Grok's phase-assignment status table showing Phase 10 as "prototype only, real implementation still to come." Verified against the actual committed code: Grok's table was stale — my earlier Phase 10 work (gitManager.ts hardening, branch panel UI, commitTurn file-list fix, CHANGELOG mojibake fix) is already committed in `0dbcd63` and confirmed intact/passing after the Phase 9A/9B work landed on top of it. Phase 10 is functionally done; nothing further planned unless new gaps surface.
- Assessed Phase 8A's flagged remaining work ("reward/disposition design") and judged it worth completing now (user gave standing permission to proceed autonomously while away): quest hooks previously had a `reward` field in the type/parser that nothing ever populated or applied — completing a quest only flipped `status` to `'completed'` with no mechanical effect.
- Implemented reward application for NPC-sourced quest hooks only (event-sourced hooks have no natural reward recipient):
  - `worldStateCore.ts` — added `npcId?`/`needId?` to `QuestHook`, parsed only when `source === 'npc'`.
  - `questGeneratorCore.ts` — `createNpcQuestHook` now sets `npcId`, `needId`, and a `reward` description.
  - `statePatch.ts` — `completeResolvedQuestHooks()` now takes a `currentTurn` param (derived from existing `state.entries` GM-role count, no new cross-module dependency) and, for each newly-completed npc-sourced hook, calls the existing `applyNpcMemoryUpdates()` (Phase 3-reviewed, already safe/clamped) with `+10 playerTrust`, resolves the matching need, and appends a memory entry.
  - `webview/modules/85-world.js` + all 4 locales — Quest Board now shows the reward text when present.
  - `scripts/test_quest_generator.js` — added assertions that npc hooks carry `npcId`/`needId`/`reward`, that event hooks never pick up stray `npcId`/`needId` from raw data, and that round-trip parsing preserves the new fields.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/test_quest_generator.js` passed (including new assertions).
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `npm test` passed (full suite green).

### Next

- None from this entry. Original Phase 10 mojibake follow-up is already resolved (see below).

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 9B code review hardening

### Summary

- Reviewed Grok commit `218ffe4` for Phase 9B multi-provider agentic GM.
- Fixed prompt ambiguity for non-file runtimes: Referee/Narrator prompts now explicitly allow stdout JSON when the provider cannot write `.text-adventure/agentic/*_result.json` directly.
- Fixed OpenRouter local agentic stage key handling so `getOpenRouterApiKey()` is called once per stage instead of twice.
- Fixed `killGmBridgeProcesses()` so an agentic-only busy state is cleared even when no child process is active.
- Added a unit assertion that agentic prompts include the stdout fallback instruction.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `python -m py_compile C:\AI\TextAdventureGMSkill\scripts\agentic_stage_gm.py` passed.
- `node scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` passed.
- `npm test` passed.

### Next

- Run real E2E turns for `grok`, `vscode-lm`, and one local API provider.
- Confirm only the merged final output writes workspace `turn_result.json`; provider stage output should be either stage JSON files or stdout parsed into those files.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Grok - Phase 9B agentic multi-provider

### Summary

- Extended Phase 9A split-role GM beyond Grok-only per `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md`:
  - `agenticGmCore.ts` — `AgenticGmProvider`, `isAgenticCapableProvider()`, provider metadata in `mergeAgenticTurnResult()`
  - `agenticGmRunner.ts` — provider dispatch (`grok` / `vscode-lm` / local LLM); stdout or stage JSON parsing; `clipboard`/`command` unchanged (handled: false)
  - `gmBridgeRunner.ts` — `runVscodeLmAgenticStage()`, `runLocalAgenticStage()`, `setAgenticBridgeBusy()`; `getOpenRouterApiKey` wired into agentic gate
  - `TextAdventureGMSkill/scripts/agentic_stage_gm.py` — ollama/koboldcpp/openrouter stage runner (stdout only, no game_state writes)
- Tests: `isAgenticCapableProvider`, provider metadata merge in `test_agentic_gm_core.js`

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed
- `node scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` passed
- `npm test` passed

### Next

- Real E2E with `textAdventure.gmBridge.agentic.enabled=true` on each target provider (especially vscode-lm and one local API).

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 9A code review hardening

### Summary

- Reviewed Grok commit `76884e0` for Phase 9A split-role GM.
- Found and fixed a high-risk stale file issue: `referee_result.json` / `narrator_result.json` could be reused from a previous turn if Grok exited successfully but did not write a fresh stage result.
- Found and fixed an instruction conflict: agentic stages were using the normal single-stage Grok prompt as their base, which includes `turn_result.json` write instructions. Agentic stages now use GM context only plus explicit stage instructions.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` passed.
- `npm test` passed.

### Next

- Before Phase 9B, run one real Grok E2E turn with `textAdventure.gmBridge.agentic.enabled=true` and confirm:
  - Referee writes only `.text-adventure/agentic/referee_result.json`.
  - Narrator writes only `.text-adventure/agentic/narrator_result.json`.
  - Only the merged final result writes workspace `turn_result.json`.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Grok - Phase 9A split-role GM prototype

### Summary

- Implemented Phase 9A per `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md`:
  - `src/agenticGmCore.ts` — pure prompt builders, JSON parsers, `mergeAgenticTurnResult()`
  - `src/agenticGmRunner.ts` — Grok-only two-stage runner (`.text-adventure/agentic/` intermediates)
  - `src/gmBridgeRunner.ts` — optional gate before provider switch; `runGrokPromptFile()` for staged spawns
  - Settings: `textAdventure.gmBridge.agentic.enabled` (default false), `fallbackToSingleStage`, `stageTimeoutMs`
  - `scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` in `npm test`
- Safety: narrator cannot override `statePatch`/`diceLedger`/`resolvedQuests`; only merged `turn_result.json` is written; `processTurnResult()` unchanged.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` + `npm test` — all green
- `node scripts/validate_utf8_docs.js` — OK

### Next

- ChatGPT review Phase 9A for fallback double-call, process cleanup, and real Grok e2e manual test.
- Phase 9B: extend beyond Grok-only if review passes.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 9 Agentic Campaign Engine design

### Summary

- Added `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md` as the source-of-truth design for Phase 9.
- Defined Phase 9A as an optional Grok-only split-role GM prototype:
  - State Referee writes mechanics-only candidate output.
  - Narrator writes prose/media hints only.
  - final `turn_result.json` remains the only accepted result.
  - `processTurnResult()` remains the final validation/application point.
- Updated `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` with a copy-ready Grok prompt that points to the new design file.
- Updated `AI_ROADMAP.md` to mark the ChatGPT/Codex design part complete and leave the Grok prototype as the next implementation task.

### Verification

- Documentation-only change. UTF-8 validation should be run after any follow-up edits.

### Next

- Give Grok the Phase 9A prompt from `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` or `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md`.
- After Grok implements, review for direct `game_state.json` writes, premature `turn_result.json` writes, narrator mechanic override, process cleanup, and fallback duplication.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Phase 10 Git Timeline hardening + branch panel

### Summary

- Multi-phase code review this session (Phase 2-6 + original vscode-lm/Cartography diff) found and verified fixes for issues later implemented by Grok/Gemini; see prior entries for those.
- Discovered `src/gitManager.ts` (`ensureGitInit`/`commitTurn`/`branchFromTurn`) was already implemented and live (auto `git init` + auto-commit every turn by default), not something to build from scratch as the Phase 10 handoff prompt assumed.
- Hardened it: one-time modal consent before the first `git init` (declining sets `textAdventure.gitAutoCommitInterval` to 0 so it isn't asked again), workspace-appropriate `.gitignore` defaults, and a guard in `branchFromTurn` that blocks branching while there are uncommitted changes (previously could silently carry dirty state onto a new branch).
- Added the "minimal Webview panel" deliverable from the Phase 10 prompt: a Git Timeline section in the Inspector tab showing the current branch and `timeline/*` branches with a Switch button. New `getGitTimelineStatus()` (read-only, only reports `timeline/`-prefixed branches) and `switchToBranch()` (checkout-only, re-verifies the branch still exists, refuses with uncommitted changes) in `gitManager.ts`; `requestGitTimeline`/`switchGitBranch` postMessage wiring in `webviewHandlers.ts`/`extension.ts`; i18n keys in all 4 locales.
- Fixed the mojibake in `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` section (header + Added/Fixed lists) by cross-referencing commit messages and this session's own verified knowledge, then rewriting in clean UTF-8.
- **Found but not fixed**: mojibake is more widespread than the `[Unreleased]` section alone — at least 155 occurrences remain further down in `CHANGELOG.md` (e.g. the `[1.7.3]`/`[1.7.2]` historical entries), likely predating this session. Codex's entry above independently found similar corruption in `package.json`/`webview/index.html` around the same time, so this looks like a recurring encoding issue in whatever tool chain does bulk edits (Python scripts on Windows without explicit `encoding='utf-8'` are the most likely culprit). Whoever touches `CHANGELOG.md` next should budget time to reconstruct the older sections from git history/commit messages rather than trust the current text.
- Still open from the Phase 10 handoff prompt: `commitTurn`'s `git add` list only covers `game_state.json`/`game_history.json`/`party.json`/`characters/`/`dice_ledger.json` — it does not include `world_forge.json`/`world_state.json`/`npc_registry.json`, so branching to an old turn does not restore world/NPC state. Flagged to the user, not yet actioned.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `npm test` passed (all suites green).
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js` passed.
- `node scripts/validate_utf8_docs.js` — OK (263 files; note this only checks byte-level UTF-8 validity, not semantic legibility, which is why the mojibake above went undetected).

- **Follow-up (same session)**: expanded `commitTurn`'s `git add` list to include `world_forge.json`/`world_state.json`/`npc_registry.json` so timeline branches actually restore world/NPC state. While implementing this, found and fixed a related pre-existing bug: `git add` fails atomically (stages nothing at all) if any single pathspec matches no files — confirmed with a throwaway repo (`git add exists.txt nonexistent.txt` exits 128 and stages neither). Since `characters/` may not exist yet early in a game, the original hardcoded `git add` list could already silently fail every auto-commit until a character file appeared. Fixed by filtering the candidate path list to `fs.existsSync` paths before calling `git add`, verified with a manual two-commit repro (turn 1 with only `game_state.json`, turn 2 after `world_forge.json` appears — both commit cleanly).
- **Follow-up 2 (same session)**: fixed the remaining historical `CHANGELOG.md` mojibake (155 occurrences across `[1.7.3]` down to `[0.1.0]`). Found that commit `9df8738` ("docs: fix mojibake and standardize UTF-8 across repository", 2026-06-29) actually held a fully clean version of the entire file (0 mojibake markers, 54 version headers matching the current file 1:1) — the corruption was reintroduced in a later commit that touched `CHANGELOG.md` again without preserving encoding. Verified the version-header list is byte-identical in order/count between that commit and the current file, then spliced: kept the current file's `[Unreleased]` section (already fixed earlier this session) and replaced everything from `## [1.7.3]` onward with the clean text from `9df8738`. `validate_utf8_docs.js` still passes (byte-level only, as before), and a manual scan confirms 0 remaining mojibake markers.

### Next

- None outstanding from this session's Phase 10 / mojibake work.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 8A Quest Hooks + planning cleanup

### Summary

- Read the current handoff/planning files and found Phase 8 work already partially present but mixed with mojibake and broken JSON/HTML fragments.
- Restored `package.json` to valid JSON and fixed malformed Webview header tags in `webview/index.html`.
- Implemented a hardened deterministic Phase 8A baseline:
  - `questGeneratorCore.ts` creates Quest Hooks from `world_state.recentChanges` and urgent NPC needs.
  - `worldStateCore.ts` parses/caps `questHooks` safely.
  - `worldView.ts` sends `questHooks` to the Webview.
  - `85-world.js` renders Quest Board items without inline onclick injection.
  - `webviewHandlers.ts` validates `acceptQuest` IDs.
  - `statePatch.ts` applies `turn_result.resolvedQuests` to `world_state.json` instead of `game_state.json`.
  - `gmPromptBuilderCore.ts` caps active quest prompt injection.
- Added `scripts/test_quest_generator.js` and included it in `npm test`.
- Added `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` with copy-ready prompts for Phase 8-11.
- Rewrote `implementation_plan.md` as a pointer to active planning files and replaced the Phase 8-11 section of `AI_ROADMAP.md` with readable UTF-8 text.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `npm test` passed, including the new quest generator tests.

### Next

- Phase 8 polish: i18n labels for Quest Board, reward/disposition effects, manual checklist steps.
- Then decide whether to continue Phase 8 polish or move to Phase 9 split-role GM architecture.
