## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Fix: duplicate player message render caused by mismatched entry ids

### Summary

**Important context first**: the user's install script had been building from `C:\AI\LoreRelay` (a stale, disconnected clone, 12 commits behind, still at v1.11.0) instead of `C:\AI\text-adventure-vsce` (this repo, the actual canonical source per `AI_HANDOVER.md`) for most of today's session — confirmed independently by Grok and ChatGPT when the user asked them to check. That explains a lot of the earlier "I fixed it but it's still broken" back-and-forth in this log. User declined to delete the stale `C:\AI\LoreRelay` for now (rename was suggested as a safer alternative by ChatGPT) — nothing done there yet, awaiting the user's call.

With the *actual* current build installed, the duplicate-player-message bug still reproduced, but with a new, precise detail from the user: after closing and restarting, the log always shows only *one* copy — so it's a live-session rendering duplicate, not an actual double-write to disk.

Root cause: `sendFreeInput()` (and the Options-button handler, and `sendDiceResultToGm()`) optimistically render the player's message immediately with a client-generated `id: user-${Date.now()}`. Once `persistPlayerInputEntry()` (a few entries below) started actually writing that message to `game_state.json`, the extension was minting its *own separate* `user-${Date.now()}` id for the same logical entry. `applyGameState()`'s dedup logic in `10-game-state.js` (`const existingIds = new Set(messageHistory.map(m => m.id)); ... if (!existingIds.has(entry.id)) { push + render }`) checks by id — since the ids never matched, the incremental `gameStateUpdate` that later arrived with the persisted entry looked "new" to the client and got rendered a second time. This bug was *latent* until the persistence fix above started actually sending the player's entry back through this path at all.

Fix: webview now generates the `entryId` up front and includes it on the `freeInput`/`selectOption` postMessage; `handlePlayerInput()`/`persistPlayerInputEntry()` (both `extension.ts`) now accept and reuse that id (validated via `isValidEntryId`) instead of generating a fresh one, so the later `gameStateUpdate` correctly recognizes it as already-rendered. Applied consistently across all three client-side optimistic-render call sites (`sendFreeInput`, the Options-button click handler, `sendDiceResultToGm`). The one non-webview call path (`notifyEquipment` → synthetic "System: [Equipment changed]..." text) has no matching optimistic render, so it was left generating its own id as before — nothing to deduplicate there.

### Verification

- `npm run build:webview`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` (0 missing), `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js`, full `npm test` — all passed.
- Not replayed live — diagnosis followed directly from reading `applyGameState()`'s dedup logic once the user's "only one copy survives a restart" detail pointed at a client-side rendering issue rather than a persistence one.

### Next

- User to confirm, from the correct `C:\AI\text-adventure-vsce` build this time, that a normal send/select/dice-roll no longer double-renders even without restarting.
- Decide what to do with the stale `C:\AI\LoreRelay` clone (rename vs. sync vs. leave alone) — not touched yet.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Fix: player messages after turn 1 never persisted to disk

### Summary

User caught this from a screenshot pair: their free-text reply ("メタルマックスやメタルサーガみたいな...") showed up correctly in the live chat right after sending, sandwiched between two GM turns — but after a reload, that same message was gone entirely from the log, while both surrounding GM turns were still there. Their own diagnosis was spot on: "自分の発言がどのタイミングで何処に書かれたかが記録されてないっぽい" (seems like my own message isn't recorded anywhere).

Traced it to `extension.ts`'s `ensureInitialGameStateForPlayerInput()`:
```ts
function ensureInitialGameStateForPlayerInput(playerAction: string): void {
    const statePath = getGameStatePath();
    if (!statePath || fs.existsSync(statePath)) { return; }  // <-- only runs when the file doesn't exist yet!
    commitGameState({ entries: [{ role: 'user', content: playerAction, ... }], ... });
}
```
This was Codex's "bootstrap minimal `game_state.json`" fix from earlier today, scoped to *only* the very first turn of a brand-new workspace. But it's the *only* place in the codebase that ever writes a player's chat entry to `game_state.json` — `mergeGmEntryFromTurn()` (`statePatch.ts`) only ever appends the GM's `role: 'gm'` entry, never a `role: 'user'` one. So from turn 2 onward, the player's message was **never durably persisted anywhere** — only ever rendered client-side in the webview (`sendFreeInput()`'s `messageHistory.push()` + `renderMessage()`), backed only by `vscode.setState()`, which gets fully overwritten the moment the authoritative `game_state.json` gets re-applied (reload, or any other `sendCurrentState()` trigger). Confirmed the in-memory `gameEntryHistory` in `gameStateSync.ts` has the same gap — it's only ever populated by re-reading the file, never by a live player-input event.

Fix: renamed to `persistPlayerInputEntry()`. It now *always* reads the current `game_state.json` (or starts a minimal one if it truly doesn't exist yet), appends the player's `role: 'user'` entry, and calls `commitGameState()` — every single turn, not just the first — before the GM bridge is invoked. Matches Persist-Before-Narrate for both halves of a turn.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` and full `npm test` passed.
- Not replayed live (no VS Code session here) — diagnosis was from the user's own screenshots plus reading the actual persistence code path, not a live repro.

### Next

- User to confirm: send several turns in a row, reload the window, and verify every player message survives (not just GM replies).
- Separately, the user also reported Shift+Enter still sending instead of inserting a newline after installing the Ctrl+Enter fix (`f423a67`) — the keydown handler in the built `webview/script.js` was re-verified correct (`e.key === 'Enter' && (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey)`, so Shift+Enter alone shouldn't match), and no other `keydown` listener touches `#free-input`. Most likely still testing a build from before `f423a67`, given the install script (`install_vscode_extension.ps1`) requires a fresh `npm run compile` + reinstall to pick up any of these changes. Flagged back to the user to confirm rather than guessed at further without being able to reproduce.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Multi-line free input + Ctrl+Enter to send

### Summary

User feedback while testing the fixes above: the free-text input is an `<input type="text">`, which can never hold a newline regardless of keydown handling (a single-line `<input>` just doesn't support `\n`), and Enter always sent immediately — no way to write a multi-line message at all. Initially planned "Enter sends, Shift+Enter newlines" (the common chat-app convention), but the user pushed back: they'd rather have **Ctrl+Enter send** and plain **Enter (or Shift+Enter) insert a newline**, reasoning that people who just hit Enter out of habit expecting a newline shouldn't accidentally send, and the Send button is right there for a one-click send anyway.

Changes:
- `webview/index.html`: `#free-input` changed from `<input type="text">` to `<textarea rows="1">`. Verified every other usage of the `freeInput` JS variable across modules (`.value`, `.focus()`, `.setSelectionRange()`, `.disabled`, `.placeholder`, `.addEventListener('input', ...)`) — all supported identically by `<textarea>`, safe drop-in swap.
- `20-input-audio-prep.js`: keydown handler now checks `e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey` before sending (Cmd+Enter on Mac too); plain/Shift+Enter falls through to the textarea's normal newline insertion.
- `00-core.js`: added `autoGrowFreeInput()` (resize height to `scrollHeight`, capped by CSS `max-height` which then scrolls). Wired to the `input` event, and called manually at every other place across `10-game-state.js`/`20-input-audio-prep.js`/`90-bootstrap.js` that sets `freeInput.value` directly (STT transcript, image-flag template, Start Hub interview template, restored draft state, clear-on-send) since programmatic `.value` assignment doesn't fire `input`.
- `styles/20-quickreply-messages.css`: `#input-area` gets `align-items: flex-end` so the buttons stay bottom-aligned as the textarea grows; `#free-input` gets `resize: none; overflow-y: auto; max-height: 140px; line-height: 1.4`.
- `webview.input.placeholder` updated in all 4 locales to mention Ctrl+Enter.

### Verification

- `npm run build:webview`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` (0 missing), `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js`, full `npm test` — all passed.

### Next

- User to confirm multi-line typing + auto-grow looks right, and Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter sends as expected, in a real session.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Codex - Localized installer BAT wrapper fix

### Summary

- `install_vscode_extension_ja.bat` failed under `cmd.exe` with mojibake and stray commands such as `'-NoProfile' is not recognized`.
- Root cause was localized wrapper `echo` text inside parenthesized batch blocks interacting badly with cmd encoding/parsing.
- Replaced wrapper messages in `install_vscode_extension_ja.bat`, `install_vscode_extension_zh-CN.bat`, and `install_vscode_extension_zh-TW.bat` with ASCII-only text while preserving `-Language ja/zh-CN/zh-TW` for the PowerShell installer.

### Verification

- `cmd /c "install_vscode_extension_ja.bat < NUL"` completed successfully and installed `lorerelay-1.11.1.vsix`.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Fix: schema violation silently dropping GM turns

### Summary

Continuing the same debugging thread as the two entries below (with the user, live, in `g:\AI\LoreRelayWorlds\PostApocalypse`). After the `turn_result.json` recovery fix, the GM turn started merging correctly — but the user then hit a new visible error toast: `extension.error.gameStateLoad (Schema Violation)`, and the duplicate-player-message symptom reappeared (same visual pattern as before: second message appears *after* the "GM がターンを処理中..." placeholder).

Investigated the schema violation: compared the two `turn_result.json` files seen earlier in this thread. The first (failed) one had `statePatch` replacing `/status` wholesale with `condition: "—"` and `inventory: "—"` (plain strings). The second (succeeded) one had `status.condition: ["世界構築フェーズ"]` (array). `validateGameState.ts` requires `condition`/`inventory`/`skills` to be arrays when present (`errors.push('status.${arrField} must be an array')` if not) — and `processTurnResult()` rejects the *entire turn* on any schema violation (`return false` before `commitGameState`), so a single field-shape inconsistency from the LLM (string vs. array) silently ate the whole turn, matching exactly what the user hit.

Fix: added `normalizeStatusArrayFields()` in `statePatch.ts`, called in `processTurnResult()` right after `mergeGmEntryFromTurn()` and before `validateGameState()`. Wraps a lone string in `status.condition`/`inventory`/`skills` into a single-element array (or `[]` if blank/whitespace), rather than rejecting the turn outright. This is a lenient-acceptance fix, not a prompt fix — the underlying Text Adventure GM Skill (outside this repo) could also be made more explicit about the array requirement, but wasn't touched here.

Also noted: the duplicate-player-message symptom looked *exactly* like the pre-fix behavior from the entry two below (`43bd071`, immediate client-side lock on send) — asked the user directly whether they're testing via a rebuilt/reinstalled build or possibly still on a stale one, since `git log` shows they'd already cut a `release: v1.11.1` version-bump commit themselves at 01:39 (metadata-only: `CHANGELOG.md`/`package.json`/`README.md`, no `webview/script.js` or `src/*.ts` changes) around the same time as their testing — worth confirming whether their install/test loop is picking up source changes made *after* that release commit.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` and full `npm test` passed.
- Could not reproduce the exact live failure again — the workspace folder was empty by the time this was investigated (user likely wiped it to restart clean). Diagnosis based on comparing the two `turn_result.json` snapshots captured earlier in this same conversation.

### Next

- Confirm with the user whether their build/install loop was actually up to date when the duplicate-send symptom reappeared.
- If schema violations recur with a different shape mismatch, extend `normalizeStatusArrayFields()` or consider making `validateGameState()`'s status-field checks more broadly lenient (coerce rather than reject) for LLM-authored content specifically.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Fix: duplicate player message race on send

### Summary

Follow-up after the `turn_result.json` recovery fix below — that one worked (the same reproduction now shows the GM turn correctly merged and rendered with option buttons), but the user still saw the player's message duplicated in the chat log, with the second copy appearing *after* the "GM がターンを処理中..." loading placeholder.

Root cause: `showGmLoading()` (`20-input-audio-prep.js`) — which sets `freeInput.disabled = true` / `sendBtn.disabled = true` — only runs when the webview receives the extension's `gmStart` postMessage, which is a round trip (webview → extension → back) after `handlePlayerInput()` starts processing. `isInputLocked()` (`10-game-state.js`) only checks `gameOverActive`, not "GM currently processing." So there's a real window between "user sends" and "input visibly locks" where a fast second Enter-press or Send click (impatient retry, or literally just fast typing) goes through and resends, since by the time it's disabled the first send has already round-tripped partway.

Fix: `sendFreeInput()` and the Options-button click handler (`renderOptions()` in `10-game-state.js`) now call `showGmLoading()` immediately, client-side, right after `vscode.postMessage(...)`, instead of waiting for `gmStart` to come back. `showGmLoading()` is idempotent (`if (document.getElementById('gm-loading')) return;`), so it's safe to still also be triggered by the later `gmStart` message. Also added a defensive `|| sendBtn.disabled` / `|| btn.disabled` to both guard checks as a second layer.

Also answered two side questions from the user: (1) a `tool_error: tool_output_error` from grok's own internal "Read" tool call appeared in the Output channel on a truly empty first-turn folder but self-recovered (exit code 0, valid `turn_result.json` still produced) — this looks like it's inside the Text Adventure GM Skill's own tool-use loop (reading a file that doesn't exist yet in a brand-new folder), not the extension's TS code, so left uninvestigated for now; (2) the "Enable Git Timeline for this workspace?" modal is the existing one-time `gitManager.ts` consent prompt (Phase 10 feature) — explained what it does, that it's optional, and left the decision to the user.

### Verification

- `npm run build:webview`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` (0 missing), `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js`, full `npm test` — all passed.

### Next

- User to confirm sending quickly (fast Enter-mashing, rapid option clicks) no longer duplicates.
- If the internal grok "Read" tool_output_error recurs or actually breaks something (rather than self-recovering), investigate the Text Adventure GM Skill's file-read assumptions for brand-new empty workspaces — that's outside this VS Code extension repo.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Fix: GM turn_result.json silently never applied (fresh workspace first turn)

### Summary

User reported (in `g:\AI\LoreRelayWorlds\PostApocalypse`, a brand-new empty world): sent the "Build via Q&A" interview kickoff message, the grok CLI GM bridge ran successfully (exit code 0, full narrative + clarifying questions visible in the "LoreRelay: GM Bridge" Output channel), but nothing appeared in the chat log — and the player's message ended up duplicated (almost certainly because the user resent it after seeing no response, not a separate bug: `sendFreeInput()`'s listeners are registered exactly once, confirmed via grep).

This is exactly the scenario Codex flagged as unverified in its "Next" note two entries below ("Retest `G:\...\PostApocalypse` after reloading the Extension Host... delete stale `turn_result.json` if present"). Inspected the actual workspace files directly:
- `turn_result.json` (3.4KB, valid JSON, `turnId: "turn-1"`, full `narration` matching the Output channel text, a 3-op `statePatch`) — mtime **after** `game_state.json`.
- `game_state.json` / `game_history.json` / `last_good_game_state.json` all identical: just the single `user` role entry, no `gm` entry, `options: []` (not the patched values) — proving `turn_result.json` was written correctly but **never actually processed**.
- No `game_state.invalid.latest.json` salvage file, ruling out a schema-validation rejection.

Root cause: `gameStateSync.ts`'s `turn_result.json` `FileSystemWatcher` relies on `onDidCreate`, which doesn't reliably fire for a file's very first creation in a directory (more failure-prone than `onDidChange` on subsequent writes) — and this is precisely the first-ever `turn_result.json` write in a brand-new workspace. `turnResultFallback.ts`'s `finishGmRun()` already had a 250ms-after-close fallback, but it only handled "GM edited `game_state.json` directly instead of writing `turn_result.json`" (`synthesizeTurnResultIfNeeded`) — there was no fallback for "wrote `turn_result.json` correctly, watcher just didn't fire."

Fix:
- `gameStateSync.ts`: extracted the watcher's read-hash-dedupe-process-postMessage logic into `processTurnResultFileAt()` (async, returns whether it processed something new) and exported `checkPendingTurnResultFile()` on top of it.
- `turnResultFallback.ts`: added `initTurnResultFallback(checkFn)` (dependency injection — avoids a circular import, since `gameStateSync.ts` already imports `markTurnResultHandled` from here). `finishGmRun()` now awaits `checkPendingTurnResultFile()` first; only falls back to the old `game_state.json`-diff synthesis if that found nothing.
- `extension.ts`: wires `initTurnResultFallback(checkPendingTurnResultFile)` alongside the existing `initGmBridgeRunner` call.
- `gameStateSync.ts`'s `startGameStateWatcher()` also now sweeps once for a leftover unprocessed `turn_result.json` on startup — so the user's *currently* stuck turn should self-heal on the next "Reload Window" once this fix is compiled in, no manual file surgery needed.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` and full `npm test` both passed.
- Could not reproduce live (no VS Code Extension Host access from here) — inspected the user's actual on-disk files directly instead to confirm the diagnosis empirically.

### Next

- User should recompile/reload and confirm: (1) the stuck turn now appears after a reload, (2) a *fresh* first turn in a new empty workspace now shows the GM response without needing a retry.
- If this recurs even after the fix, next suspect would be `processTurnResult()` itself throwing past the retry's hash-dedupe guard (was ruled out here since `game_state.invalid.latest.json` didn't exist and `processTurnResult` already catches its own errors and returns `false` rather than throwing — but worth re-checking if a new failure mode shows up).

---

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Audit + fix remaining webview confirm()/prompt()/alert() calls

### Summary

Follow-up to the delete-character confirm fix below (same root cause: VS Code webview iframes lack `allow-modals`, so `confirm()`/`prompt()`/`alert()` are silently ignored — they return falsy/undefined immediately with no UI, so code guarded by them just does nothing). Per the user's request, audited every remaining call site (`grep -rn "confirm(\|prompt(\|alert("` across `webview/modules/`) and fixed each:

- **Rewind to turn** — 🔱 per-message action (`10-game-state.js`, sends `branchFromEntry`) and the input-bar rewind button (`20-input-audio-prep.js`, sends `restoreToTurn`) both reach `handleRestoreToTurn` in the extension. Both now gate on a shared `confirmDestructive()` helper added to `webviewHandlers.ts` (native `vscode.window.showWarningMessage({ modal: true })`), removing the broken webview `confirm()` from the first and adding the same guard to the second (which previously had no confirm attempt at all, silently inconsistent with the first).
- **Git Timeline branch creation** — ⎇ button in both `10-game-state.js` and the Inspector panel (`80-inspector.js`) send `branchTimeline`; confirmation is now centralized in the `branchTimeline` case in `webviewHandlers.ts`, fixing both call sites at once.
- **Checkpoint label** — both the input-bar and quick-reply "save checkpoint" buttons used `window.prompt()` for an optional label, always silently ignored (label always ended up blank/auto-generated `Turn N` — `saveCheckpointFile()` already had that fallback, so saves "worked" but custom naming silently never did). Replaced with `vscode.window.showInputBox()` in the `saveCheckpoint` case.
- **Lorebook entry delete** — this one is purely client-side draft state (not persisted until the explicit Save button), so instead of a round trip to the extension host, added a small reusable `webviewConfirm(message, label): Promise<boolean>` in `00-core.js` (in-page modal, styled via new `.wv-confirm-*` classes in `00-base.css`) and used it here.
- **Lorebook save-failure `alert()`** — removed; `handleSaveLorebook()` in `extension.ts` already calls `vscode.window.showErrorMessage()` with the same error detail, so the webview alert was both broken and redundant.
- **Quickstart empty-prompt `alert()`** (`05-quickstart.js`) — replaced with an inline `.invalid` state on the textarea (red border + focus) instead of a popup; new `.cc-input.invalid`/`.cc-textarea.invalid` style in `95-character-creator.css`.

New i18n keys added (4 locales): `webview.confirm.cancel`, `webview.confirm.ok`, `webview.lorebook.deleteConfirmBtn`, `extension.confirm.rewind(Button)`, `extension.confirm.gitBranch(Button)`, `extension.prompt.checkpointLabel(Placeholder)`. Removed now-unused `webview.msg.rewindConfirm`, `webview.msg.gitBranchConfirm`, `webview.checkpoint.savePrompt`.

### Verification

- `npm run build:webview`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` (0 missing), `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js`, full `npm test` — all passed.
- Still not manually played in a live VS Code session. Someone should verify: rewind/branch/checkpoint-label modals actually appear and behave correctly, lorebook delete's in-page confirm works, and quickstart's empty-field state is visible.

### Next

- Manual in-app verification of all five fixes above in a real VS Code session.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Fix: delete-character confirm dialog never appeared

### Summary

Follow-up to the same-day Character Creator i18n + delete fix below. User reported: clicking 🗑 Delete in the Character Profile pane did nothing — no confirmation popup, no deletion.

Root cause: the click handler used the webview's `window.confirm()`. VS Code webviews render content inside a sandboxed iframe that is **not** granted `allow-modals`, so `confirm()`/`alert()`/`prompt()` are silently no-ops there — the call returns falsy immediately with no UI shown, and `if (!confirm(...)) return;` bailed out every time. This is a general VS Code webview limitation, not specific to this feature; other `confirm()` calls already in this codebase (rewind-to-turn, git branch creation, lorebook delete in `webview/modules/*.js`) are likely affected the same way but hadn't been reported yet — worth checking during a future pass.

Fix: moved the confirmation off the webview entirely. `webview/modules/50-character-saga.js`'s delete handler now just posts `{ type: 'deleteCharacter', id, name }` directly (no `confirm()`). `webviewHandlers.ts`'s `deleteCharacter` case now shows a native `vscode.window.showWarningMessage(msg, { modal: true }, 'Delete')` and only calls `deps.deleteCharacter(id)` if the user picks the Delete button — this matches the existing modal-confirm pattern already used in `gitManager.ts` (Git Timeline init consent), `extension.ts`, and `scenarioPack.ts`. Added `extension.confirm.deleteCharacter` / `extension.confirm.deleteCharacterButton` i18n keys (4 locales) and removed the now-unused `webview.character.deleteConfirm` key.

### Verification

- `npm run build:webview`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` (0 missing), full `npm test` all passed.
- Still not manually played in a live VS Code session — user should confirm the native modal now appears and deletion actually happens end-to-end.

### Next

- Consider auditing the other `confirm()` calls in webview modules (rewind, git branch, lorebook delete) for the same silent-no-op issue and moving them to extension-host modal dialogs too.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Character Creator i18n + delete character

### Summary

User reported two issues in the Full Character Editor ("✏️ Full Editor" modal, opened from the Character Profile pane): switching the app locale to Japanese left the whole editor in English, and there was no way to delete a character at all.

Investigated and confirmed both:
- `webview/index.html`'s `#char-creator-modal` block (~170 lines) had zero `data-i18n`/`data-i18n-placeholder`/`data-i18n-title` attributes, and `webview/modules/52-character-creator.js` built several dynamic strings (default sprite-expression labels, sprite action tooltips, the "— New Character" subtitle, the add-custom-expression mini-form, the world-adaptation draft's "(no change)" fallback) as raw JS literals — none of it wired into the `T()` i18n system used everywhere else in the webview.
- There was no delete-character code path anywhere: no button, no `deleteCharacter` postMessage type, no backend function. `characterManager.ts` only had create/save/set-active/party add-remove.

Fixed:
- Added ~90 new `webview.characterCreator.*` i18n keys (plus a few `webview.character.*` ones for the compact panel) across all 4 locale files (en/ja/zh-TW/zh-CN), matching the existing tone/style of each locale's other `webview.character.*` entries.
- Retrofitted `index.html`'s full editor markup with `data-i18n`/`-placeholder`/`-title` attributes (simplified the portrait drop-zone hint from a `<br>`-containing string to one line, since `applyI18n()` sets `textContent` and can't render HTML tags) and switched `52-character-creator.js`'s dynamic strings to `T()` calls.
- Added a 🗑 Delete button next to Save in the compact Character Profile pane (disabled when "-- New Character --" is selected), guarded by a `confirm()` dialog. Wired `deleteCharacter(id)` in `characterManager.ts` — removes the character JSON, any portrait/expression image files it references (path-validated to stay inside `characters/`), clears `active_character.txt` if it pointed at the deleted id, and calls the existing `removeFromParty()` — through `webviewHandlers.ts` (`deleteCharacter` case, mirrors the `deleteCheckpoint` pattern) and `extension.ts` wiring.

### Verification

- `npm run build:webview`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` (0 missing across all 4 locales), `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js`, and the full `npm test` all passed.
- Not manually played in a live VS Code Extension Host session (no interactive environment here) — someone should confirm in-app that the Full Editor now renders in Japanese/zh-TW/zh-CN and that deleting a character actually removes its files and updates the character dropdown.

### Next

- Manual in-app verification of both fixes (locale switch + delete flow) in a real VS Code session.

## 2026-07-02 JST - Codex - Empty world onboarding / active character leak fix

### Summary

- Fixed first-turn onboarding in an empty workspace: `handlePlayerInput()` now creates a minimal `game_state.json` before invoking the GM bridge when no state file exists yet.
- `processTurnResult()` can now merge a `turn_result.json` even if `game_state.json` is absent, using a minimal schema-current state as the merge base.
- Imported/active character cards no longer auto-enter GM party context. `getPartyMemberIds()` and `buildPartyPromptContext()` now use explicit party membership only, preventing test ST cards such as `クロノ` from being treated as the protagonist/companion.
- GM prompt locale strings now explicitly require `turn_result.json` as UTF-8 JSON and warn Windows PowerShell users to use `-Encoding utf8`.
- Local GM skill copy updated at `C:\AI\TextAdventureGMSkill\SKILL.md` with the same UTF-8 warning; this file is outside the VS Code extension Git repo.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `npm test` passed.

### Next

- Retest `G:\AI\LoreRelayWorlds\PostApocalypse` after reloading the Extension Host. If an old mojibake `turn_result.json` remains, delete it once before retrying so the watcher does not keep seeing stale invalid output.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Phase 11 schema/mood/UI review

### Summary

Completed the Claude review requested in `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` (Phase 11 "Prompt for Claude"). Patched `PHASE11_ADAPTIVE_TTS_DESIGN.md` §5–7 only, no implementation:

- **§5 (schema/clamps):** confirmed `NpcVoiceProfile` fields; added concrete `clampVoiceRate/Volume/Pitch` pseudocode using `Number.isFinite` (not just `!isNaN`, to also reject `Infinity` — same class of gap flagged for `validateGameState.ts` HP/MP fields) and a `sanitizeVoiceId()` that **rejects** (not truncates) strings containing path separators/control chars. Firmed up `speakerNpcId` recommendation to **defer to 11B** with explicit reasons (turn_result schema risk, unreliable across clipboard/manual providers, small marginal win over sender-name matching).
- **§6 (mood table):** proposed a concrete `applyMoodModifiers()` numeric table for all 7 `NpcMood` values (excited/angry/fearful fastest+brightest, sad slowest+flattest, neutral no-op), additive deltas re-clamped after applying so `moodAdaptive` only nudges an explicit profile, never overrides it.
- **§7 (attribution + UI):** documented 3 edge cases — duplicate NPC names (prefer location match, else skip override rather than guess), GM self-narration/quoted dialogue (attribution stays entry-granularity only, no substring guessing inside prose), NPC renamed mid-campaign (accepted best-effort miss). Specified the World tab 🔊 Preview button DOM placement (`world-npc-info`, after the portrait button in `webview/modules/85-world.js`) and 3 new `webview.world.*` i18n keys for the 4 locale files, confirmed `T(key, vars)` already supports `{name}`-style interpolation (`webview/modules/00-core.js`).

No code changes — design doc only, per the prompt's "Do NOT implement yet" constraint. Phase 10 (also assigned to Claude in the same file) is already fully implemented per `AI_ROADMAP.md`; only the manual real-play branch-switch test remains outstanding there.

### Next

- Grok: Phase 11A implementation per updated `PHASE11_ADAPTIVE_TTS_DESIGN.md`.
- Someone with an interactive VS Code session: manual Phase 10 Git Timeline branch/switch playtest (still unconfirmed per roadmap).

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Start Hub for empty workspaces + index.html mojibake cleanup

### Summary

- User tested a fresh world folder (`G:\AI\LoreRelayWorlds\PostApocalypse`) and found the empty-state chat log gave no indication of what to do. Discussed with ChatGPT, who investigated the existing Quickstart feature (already fully implemented: `#quickstart-modal` + `quickstartRunner.ts`, just poorly discoverable behind an unlabeled 🚀 icon) and produced a hybrid spec: keep Quickstart as "generate roughly from one line," add a new (future) "GM interview" mode as "build via Q&A," and show both as a `Start Hub` choice screen whenever the workspace is empty, with theme presets feeding either path.
- Implemented the UI/discoverability half per ChatGPT's spec (backend interview-mode logic intentionally deferred as future work, per spec):
  - `webview/index.html` — new `#start-hub` block (sibling of `#chat-log`, not a child — `chatLog.innerHTML = ''` on re-render would otherwise wipe it) with a title, two big option buttons (Quick Generate / Build via Q&A), and 5 preset chips.
  - `webview/styles/10-layout-chat.css` — `.start-hub` fills the same flex slot as `#chat-log`; `#chat-log.hidden`/`.start-hub.hidden` toggle between them.
  - `webview/modules/90-bootstrap.js` — `updateStartHubVisibility()` (single source of truth: shows hub iff `messageHistory.length === 0`), preset chip single-select state, Quick Generate button opens the existing quickstart modal and pre-fills its prompt textarea with the selected preset's one-line description, Q&A button pre-fills `freeInput` with an interview-kickoff template (consistent with the earlier image-mismatch-flag button pattern) and focuses it rather than auto-sending.
  - `webview/modules/10-game-state.js` — `renderMessage()` now calls `updateStartHubVisibility()` at its very end, so every code path that adds a message (welcome check, `applyGameState` loading real entries, remote input, system messages) automatically keeps the hub's visibility correct without needing to hook each call site individually.
  - Replaced the old unconditional `addSystemMessage(T('webview.welcome'))` call with the hub (its title serves the same purpose); i18n key `webview.welcome` is now unused but left defined (harmless, not worth the risk of touching it).
  - 13 new i18n keys × 4 locales.
- **Unrelated finding, fixed while in the file**: `webview/index.html` had real mojibake — 11 quick-reply button fallback labels (garbled emoji + text), ~15 corrupted HTML comments, and an `…` (ellipsis) that had been mangled into `窶ｦ` repeated across ~13 character-creator placeholder strings. Verified against the corresponding `locales/*.json` values (which were clean) that this was low-severity — `applyI18n()` overwrites the fallback text immediately on load — but cleaned it up for source readability. Confirmed 0 remaining occurrences of the known corruption markers across `webview/`, `src/`, and `locales/` afterward.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js` passed.
- `node scripts/validate_utf8_docs.js` — OK (267 files).
- `npm test` passed (full suite green).

### Next

- GM interview mode itself (the "💬 Build via Q&A" backend) is not implemented — clicking it only pre-fills a kickoff message into the normal chat input, which then flows through whichever GM bridge provider is already configured. Per ChatGPT's spec, when that gets built: keep `setupComplete` as an advisory signal only, use an explicit always-visible "generate the world from this" button as the real trigger (not AI self-judgment), and route through `invokeGmBridge` (not `quickstartRunner.ts`'s `generateText()`, which only supports openrouter/ollama/koboldcpp) so it works with any configured provider.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Image/narrative mismatch feedback button

### Summary

- User + ChatGPT identified a UX gap during test play: a generated scene image (map spread on a table, per the narration) didn't match what was actually rendered (map on the ground, no table/characters). ChatGPT proposed a "flag this image" button that pre-fills a template complaint for the GM.
- Implemented the simpler of ChatGPT's two proposals (template pre-fill into free input, sent through the existing GM turn flow) rather than the fuller accept/discard/retake variant, to avoid new message types or backend changes.
- `webview/modules/10-game-state.js` — added a "🗯️ Flag Mismatch" button next to the existing regenerate button on every scene image; wrapped both in a new `.image-editor-actions` flex row. Clicking it sets `freeInput.value` to a template string and focuses/positions the cursor at the end so the user can type the specific complaint before sending normally.
- `webview/styles/80-image-gen.css` — new `.image-editor-actions` row wrapper; `.image-flag-btn` gets a distinct amber accent from the existing purple regenerate/manual-gen buttons; restored `align-self: flex-end` on `.manual-gen-btn` specifically since it's still used standalone outside the new row.
- i18n: 3 new keys (`webview.image.flagMismatchBtn/Title/Template`) in all 4 locales.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js` passed.
- `npm test` passed (full suite green).

### Next

- Not yet built: the fuller "accept / discard / regenerate with corrected prompt" 4-button variant ChatGPT also proposed. Left as a follow-up if the simple version proves not enough — would need a new postMessage type and prompt-rewriting logic on the image-gen side.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Phase 8A quest completion rewards + Phase 10 status check

### Summary

- User relayed Grok's phase-assignment status table showing Phase 10 as "prototype only, real implementation still to come." Verified against the actual committed code: Grok's table was stale — my earlier Phase 10 work (gitManager.ts hardening, branch panel UI, commitTurn file-list fix, CHANGELOG mojibake fix) is already committed in `0dbcd63` and confirmed intact/passing after the Phase 9A/9B work landed on top of it. Phase 10 is functionally done; nothing further planned unless new gaps surface.
- Assessed Phase 8A's flagged remaining work ("reward/disposition design") and judged it worth completing now (user gave standing permission to proceed autonomously while away): quest hooks previously had a `reward` field in the type/parser that nothing ever populated or applied — completing a quest only flipped `status` to `'completed'` with no mechanical effect.
- Implemented reward application for NPC-sourced quest hooks only (event-sourced hooks have no natural reward recipient):
  - `worldStateCore.ts` — added `npcId?`/`needId?` to `QuestHook`, parsed only when `source === 'npc'`.
  - `questGeneratorCore.ts` — `createNpcQuestHook` now sets `npcId`, `needId`, and a `reward` description.
  - `statePatch.ts` — `completeResolvedQuestHooks()` now takes a `currentTurn` param (derived from existing `state.entries` GM-role count, no new cross-module dependency) and, for each newly-completed npc-sourced hook, calls the existing `applyNpcMemoryUpdates()` (Phase 3-reviewed, already safe/clamped) with `+10 playerTrust`, resolves the matching need, and appends a memory entry.
  - `webview/modules/85-world.js` + all 4 locales — Quest Board now shows the reward text when present.
  - `scripts/test_quest_generator.js` — added assertions that npc hooks carry `npcId`/`needId`/`reward`, that event hooks never pick up stray `npcId`/`needId` from raw data, and that round-trip parsing preserves the new fields.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/test_quest_generator.js` passed (including new assertions).
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `npm test` passed (full suite green).

### Next

- None from this entry. Original Phase 10 mojibake follow-up is already resolved (see below).

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 9B code review hardening

### Summary

- Reviewed Grok commit `218ffe4` for Phase 9B multi-provider agentic GM.
- Fixed prompt ambiguity for non-file runtimes: Referee/Narrator prompts now explicitly allow stdout JSON when the provider cannot write `.text-adventure/agentic/*_result.json` directly.
- Fixed OpenRouter local agentic stage key handling so `getOpenRouterApiKey()` is called once per stage instead of twice.
- Fixed `killGmBridgeProcesses()` so an agentic-only busy state is cleared even when no child process is active.
- Added a unit assertion that agentic prompts include the stdout fallback instruction.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `python -m py_compile C:\AI\TextAdventureGMSkill\scripts\agentic_stage_gm.py` passed.
- `node scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` passed.
- `npm test` passed.

### Next

- Run real E2E turns for `grok`, `vscode-lm`, and one local API provider.
- Confirm only the merged final output writes workspace `turn_result.json`; provider stage output should be either stage JSON files or stdout parsed into those files.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Grok - Phase 9B agentic multi-provider

### Summary

- Extended Phase 9A split-role GM beyond Grok-only per `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md`:
  - `agenticGmCore.ts` — `AgenticGmProvider`, `isAgenticCapableProvider()`, provider metadata in `mergeAgenticTurnResult()`
  - `agenticGmRunner.ts` — provider dispatch (`grok` / `vscode-lm` / local LLM); stdout or stage JSON parsing; `clipboard`/`command` unchanged (handled: false)
  - `gmBridgeRunner.ts` — `runVscodeLmAgenticStage()`, `runLocalAgenticStage()`, `setAgenticBridgeBusy()`; `getOpenRouterApiKey` wired into agentic gate
  - `TextAdventureGMSkill/scripts/agentic_stage_gm.py` — ollama/koboldcpp/openrouter stage runner (stdout only, no game_state writes)
- Tests: `isAgenticCapableProvider`, provider metadata merge in `test_agentic_gm_core.js`

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed
- `node scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` passed
- `npm test` passed

### Next

- Real E2E with `textAdventure.gmBridge.agentic.enabled=true` on each target provider (especially vscode-lm and one local API).

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 9A code review hardening

### Summary

- Reviewed Grok commit `76884e0` for Phase 9A split-role GM.
- Found and fixed a high-risk stale file issue: `referee_result.json` / `narrator_result.json` could be reused from a previous turn if Grok exited successfully but did not write a fresh stage result.
- Found and fixed an instruction conflict: agentic stages were using the normal single-stage Grok prompt as their base, which includes `turn_result.json` write instructions. Agentic stages now use GM context only plus explicit stage instructions.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `node scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` passed.
- `npm test` passed.

### Next

- Before Phase 9B, run one real Grok E2E turn with `textAdventure.gmBridge.agentic.enabled=true` and confirm:
  - Referee writes only `.text-adventure/agentic/referee_result.json`.
  - Narrator writes only `.text-adventure/agentic/narrator_result.json`.
  - Only the merged final result writes workspace `turn_result.json`.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Grok - Phase 9A split-role GM prototype

### Summary

- Implemented Phase 9A per `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md`:
  - `src/agenticGmCore.ts` — pure prompt builders, JSON parsers, `mergeAgenticTurnResult()`
  - `src/agenticGmRunner.ts` — Grok-only two-stage runner (`.text-adventure/agentic/` intermediates)
  - `src/gmBridgeRunner.ts` — optional gate before provider switch; `runGrokPromptFile()` for staged spawns
  - Settings: `textAdventure.gmBridge.agentic.enabled` (default false), `fallbackToSingleStage`, `stageTimeoutMs`
  - `scripts/test_agentic_gm_core.js` in `npm test`
- Safety: narrator cannot override `statePatch`/`diceLedger`/`resolvedQuests`; only merged `turn_result.json` is written; `processTurnResult()` unchanged.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` + `npm test` — all green
- `node scripts/validate_utf8_docs.js` — OK

### Next

- ChatGPT review Phase 9A for fallback double-call, process cleanup, and real Grok e2e manual test.
- Phase 9B: extend beyond Grok-only if review passes.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 9 Agentic Campaign Engine design

### Summary

- Added `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md` as the source-of-truth design for Phase 9.
- Defined Phase 9A as an optional Grok-only split-role GM prototype:
  - State Referee writes mechanics-only candidate output.
  - Narrator writes prose/media hints only.
  - final `turn_result.json` remains the only accepted result.
  - `processTurnResult()` remains the final validation/application point.
- Updated `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` with a copy-ready Grok prompt that points to the new design file.
- Updated `AI_ROADMAP.md` to mark the ChatGPT/Codex design part complete and leave the Grok prototype as the next implementation task.

### Verification

- Documentation-only change. UTF-8 validation should be run after any follow-up edits.

### Next

- Give Grok the Phase 9A prompt from `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` or `PHASE9_AGENTIC_CAMPAIGN_DESIGN.md`.
- After Grok implements, review for direct `game_state.json` writes, premature `turn_result.json` writes, narrator mechanic override, process cleanup, and fallback duplication.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Claude (Sonnet 5) - Phase 10 Git Timeline hardening + branch panel

### Summary

- Multi-phase code review this session (Phase 2-6 + original vscode-lm/Cartography diff) found and verified fixes for issues later implemented by Grok/Gemini; see prior entries for those.
- Discovered `src/gitManager.ts` (`ensureGitInit`/`commitTurn`/`branchFromTurn`) was already implemented and live (auto `git init` + auto-commit every turn by default), not something to build from scratch as the Phase 10 handoff prompt assumed.
- Hardened it: one-time modal consent before the first `git init` (declining sets `textAdventure.gitAutoCommitInterval` to 0 so it isn't asked again), workspace-appropriate `.gitignore` defaults, and a guard in `branchFromTurn` that blocks branching while there are uncommitted changes (previously could silently carry dirty state onto a new branch).
- Added the "minimal Webview panel" deliverable from the Phase 10 prompt: a Git Timeline section in the Inspector tab showing the current branch and `timeline/*` branches with a Switch button. New `getGitTimelineStatus()` (read-only, only reports `timeline/`-prefixed branches) and `switchToBranch()` (checkout-only, re-verifies the branch still exists, refuses with uncommitted changes) in `gitManager.ts`; `requestGitTimeline`/`switchGitBranch` postMessage wiring in `webviewHandlers.ts`/`extension.ts`; i18n keys in all 4 locales.
- Fixed the mojibake in `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` section (header + Added/Fixed lists) by cross-referencing commit messages and this session's own verified knowledge, then rewriting in clean UTF-8.
- **Found but not fixed**: mojibake is more widespread than the `[Unreleased]` section alone — at least 155 occurrences remain further down in `CHANGELOG.md` (e.g. the `[1.7.3]`/`[1.7.2]` historical entries), likely predating this session. Codex's entry above independently found similar corruption in `package.json`/`webview/index.html` around the same time, so this looks like a recurring encoding issue in whatever tool chain does bulk edits (Python scripts on Windows without explicit `encoding='utf-8'` are the most likely culprit). Whoever touches `CHANGELOG.md` next should budget time to reconstruct the older sections from git history/commit messages rather than trust the current text.
- Still open from the Phase 10 handoff prompt: `commitTurn`'s `git add` list only covers `game_state.json`/`game_history.json`/`party.json`/`characters/`/`dice_ledger.json` — it does not include `world_forge.json`/`world_state.json`/`npc_registry.json`, so branching to an old turn does not restore world/NPC state. Flagged to the user, not yet actioned.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `npm test` passed (all suites green).
- `node scripts/check_i18n_keys.js` — 0 missing in all 4 locales.
- `node scripts/validate_webview_html_structure.js` passed.
- `node scripts/validate_utf8_docs.js` — OK (263 files; note this only checks byte-level UTF-8 validity, not semantic legibility, which is why the mojibake above went undetected).

- **Follow-up (same session)**: expanded `commitTurn`'s `git add` list to include `world_forge.json`/`world_state.json`/`npc_registry.json` so timeline branches actually restore world/NPC state. While implementing this, found and fixed a related pre-existing bug: `git add` fails atomically (stages nothing at all) if any single pathspec matches no files — confirmed with a throwaway repo (`git add exists.txt nonexistent.txt` exits 128 and stages neither). Since `characters/` may not exist yet early in a game, the original hardcoded `git add` list could already silently fail every auto-commit until a character file appeared. Fixed by filtering the candidate path list to `fs.existsSync` paths before calling `git add`, verified with a manual two-commit repro (turn 1 with only `game_state.json`, turn 2 after `world_forge.json` appears — both commit cleanly).
- **Follow-up 2 (same session)**: fixed the remaining historical `CHANGELOG.md` mojibake (155 occurrences across `[1.7.3]` down to `[0.1.0]`). Found that commit `9df8738` ("docs: fix mojibake and standardize UTF-8 across repository", 2026-06-29) actually held a fully clean version of the entire file (0 mojibake markers, 54 version headers matching the current file 1:1) — the corruption was reintroduced in a later commit that touched `CHANGELOG.md` again without preserving encoding. Verified the version-header list is byte-identical in order/count between that commit and the current file, then spliced: kept the current file's `[Unreleased]` section (already fixed earlier this session) and replaced everything from `## [1.7.3]` onward with the clean text from `9df8738`. `validate_utf8_docs.js` still passes (byte-level only, as before), and a manual scan confirms 0 remaining mojibake markers.

### Next

- None outstanding from this session's Phase 10 / mojibake work.

## 2026-07-01 JST - Codex - Phase 8A Quest Hooks + planning cleanup

### Summary

- Read the current handoff/planning files and found Phase 8 work already partially present but mixed with mojibake and broken JSON/HTML fragments.
- Restored `package.json` to valid JSON and fixed malformed Webview header tags in `webview/index.html`.
- Implemented a hardened deterministic Phase 8A baseline:
  - `questGeneratorCore.ts` creates Quest Hooks from `world_state.recentChanges` and urgent NPC needs.
  - `worldStateCore.ts` parses/caps `questHooks` safely.
  - `worldView.ts` sends `questHooks` to the Webview.
  - `85-world.js` renders Quest Board items without inline onclick injection.
  - `webviewHandlers.ts` validates `acceptQuest` IDs.
  - `statePatch.ts` applies `turn_result.resolvedQuests` to `world_state.json` instead of `game_state.json`.
  - `gmPromptBuilderCore.ts` caps active quest prompt injection.
- Added `scripts/test_quest_generator.js` and included it in `npm test`.
- Added `phase8_planning_and_prompts.md` with copy-ready prompts for Phase 8-11.
- Rewrote `implementation_plan.md` as a pointer to active planning files and replaced the Phase 8-11 section of `AI_ROADMAP.md` with readable UTF-8 text.

### Verification

- `npm run compile` passed.
- `npm test` passed, including the new quest generator tests.

### Next

- Phase 8 polish: i18n labels for Quest Board, reward/disposition effects, manual checklist steps.
- Then decide whether to continue Phase 8 polish or move to Phase 9 split-role GM architecture.
